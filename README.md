#The Evolution of FizzBuzz

## History

3.1.1 -- just tweaking the readme a bit. 

3.1.0 meatpile.js -- The world doesn't have enough case switches, but today we help contribute to the solution. 

3.0.0 deathpill.js -- You know what we do need, though? Function arguments. That's a breaking change, so welcome to FizzBuzz3. You can now define the value to fizz on, the value to buzz on, the number to start on, and the number to end on and I realize that's a lot of arguments but FizzBuzz is serious business, yo. 

2.3.0 cleathill.js -- You know what we also don't need? An incrementor. 

2.2.0 gleanball.js -- That results variable isn't actually needed. Lets get rid of it. 

2.1.0 grailboss.js -- Some people hate if statements. I'm not one of those people, but lets turn everything into ternary operators anyway.

2.0.0 FizzBuzz -- Originally all of these functions existed in separate repositories. That's a pain in the ass, so they've all been integrated into a single repository, and the old repositories have been deleted. Therefore, I've renamed the project The Evolution of FizzBuzz, because it's more descriptive. 

1.5.0 grillmoss.js -- That while loop bothers me. Let's make the leap and convert this function into a recursive function. Also, there's no particular reason we need to assign the function to a variable, so let's not do that. Finally, the instructions to run this function have been updated to be more explicit.

1.4.0 drillmost.js -- Hey, check it out, a history section has been added. Now it's easy to see the evolution of fizzbuzz. Also, we've refactored the if-statement a bit. There's no reason to repeat those strings, right? This makes for a more efficient function. 

1.3.0 drizzmosk.js -- As a fizzbuzz, this isn't bad, but it could be more DRY. Instead of all those console.logs, lets use the if-statement to build a string and then log it to the console at the end. 

1.2.0 frizzbask.js -- Two changes this time. First, we're adding a complete README.md file, with instructions and stuff. Secondly, lets get rid of that for-loop. Counting for-loops always bother me and I always want to remove them, so instead Frizzbask uses a while loop.

1.1.0 flizzbazz.js -- Let's improve on FizzBuzz. FlizzBazz still flizzes on 3s and bazzes 5s, but now it's running as an immediately-invoking function. 

1.0.0 fizzbuzz.js -- This is a simple fizzbuzz, where we fizz on 3, buzz on 5 and fizzbuzz on 15.
